            Gel Is Both A Great Value And Great For Dogs and Cats With
            Inflammation and Gum Problems. Can be used on its own or in
            conjunction with the water additive for pets with more problematic
            teeth and gums. The dog gel tastes much like the water additive
            ÔøΩnormal water with a very subtle hint of cinnamon. The cat formula
            has the omega 3 salmon oil flavor and we know from both our clinical
            studies and current clients that their cats LOVE the taste so much
            so that they wait to have the gel applied each day. YES. You will be
            able not only get into your cat's mouth, but he/she will love for
            you. And the gel is especially effective for your cat's inflammation
            and gum issues
